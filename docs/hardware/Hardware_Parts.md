- **Antennas (VHF & UHF/S-Band)**: Transmit (VHF), receive (UHF, S-Band if added).
- **Rotator Assembly**: Points directional antennas accurately at the satellite.
- **SDR (Software Defined Radio)**: Receives UHF/S-Band; may drive VHF transmit.
- **LNA (Low Noise Amplifier)**: Boosts weak downlink signals before SDR.
- **Transmit Radio/Amplifier (VHF)**: Dedicated unit for robust VHF uplink signal.
- **Filters (RF)**: Minimize interference on uplink and downlink bands.
- **Control Computer/Server**: Runs all ground station software and processing.
- **Network Equipment**: For local connectivity and internet access.
- **Power Supply System**: Provides stable power to all components.
